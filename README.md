# Bagel-Sales-Predictive-Analytics

### Description

The objective of this project was to demonstrate to a bagel shop business owner the strategic advantages of utilizing data to enhance productivity. Since the business lacked existing data collection methods, I devised a simulated dataset reflecting the perceived trends observed by the owner over the past two years of operation. Initially, the owner highlighted the significant variations in sales corresponding to seasonal changes. To address this, I incorporated average monthly high and low temperatures for Nederland, Colorado, randomly selecting temperatures within that range, with a slight chance of deviating from it. Furthermore, recognizing the importance of holiday rushes, I integrated holiday data into the dataset. The owner also provided monthly sales range estimates, from which I randomly selected figures for each month. Notably, the owner emphasized that weekend traffic was twice as high as on weekdays. Additionally, the owner requested the inclusion of daily sales figures for each type/flavor of bagel sold. This particular data point enabled the manager to identify popular flavors and adjust production accordingly to prevent stock shortages. Then, Within the data investigator python notebook file I showed the owner ways in which to chart the data anlong with ways to make predictions on best ways to predict the dataset.
